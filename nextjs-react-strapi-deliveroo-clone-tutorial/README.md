## Strapi:
 [**Strapi** ](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) is the most advanced open-source **Node.js Headless Content Management System** used to build scalable, secure, production ready API's quickly and efficiently saving developers countless hours of development.

 With its extensible plugin system, it provides a large set of built-in features: Admin Panel, Authentication & Permissions management, Content Management, API Generator, etc. Unlike online CMS, **Strapi is 100% open-source** (take a look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/strapi/strapi)), which means:

 * Strapi is **completely free**.
 * You can **host it on your own servers**, so you own the data.
 * It is entirely **customizable and extensible**, thanks to the plugin system.

## Next.js:
[ **Next** ](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/ ) is a lightweight development framework to create static, server rendered applications in **React**. Next.js will take care of the heavy lifting of the application such as *code splitting, HMR (hot module replacement) and SSR (server side rendering)* and allow us to focus on the application.

## React:  
[**React**](https://github.com/facebook/react) is one of the most popular front end Javascript frameworks, developed by facebook and used by countless tech companies including *Netflix, Airbnb and Github* to build applications. React is a declarative library that makes it easy to create interactive user interfaces, keeping the code base organized through its *component based architecture*.  

### GraphQL:
[**GraphQL**](https://github.com/graphql) is a query language also developed by Facebook to allow the front end of an application to easily query an application's API. Each query requests only the data needed to be rendered by the current view. This allows the developer to craft a great user experience across *multiple devices and screen sizes*.

### Stripe:
[**Stripe**](https://github.com/stripe) is one of (if not the largest) payment processor's for application today. Stripe has developed the tools and SDKs to allow developers to craft and integrate *secure, compliant payment processing* into any app with easy.
